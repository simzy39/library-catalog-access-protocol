# LCAP Fulfillment – Basic Circulation Profile

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Frozen

---

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines the **LCAP Fulfillment – Basic Circulation Profile**.

The Fulfillment – Basic profile specifies a minimal, explicit, and deterministic set of **circulation-related actions** that MAY be declared by LCAP Core–conformant servers.

This profile defines:

* standard circulation actions
* action declaration requirements
* allowed action outcomes
* explicit failure and denial semantics

This profile does **not** define:

* lending policy
* eligibility rules
* DRM mechanisms
* delivery formats
* authentication or identity systems
* UI flows or patron experience

Fulfillment – Basic extends **LCAP Core** and MUST be implemented in full to claim conformance to this profile.

---

## 2. Normative Language and Dependencies

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

An implementation claiming conformance to this profile:

* MUST be fully conformant with **LCAP Core**
* MUST implement all requirements in this document
* MUST NOT weaken or reinterpret Core requirements

---

## 3. Fulfillment Model Overview

### 3.1 Actions as Explicit Operations

In LCAP, fulfillment is expressed **only through explicit action declarations**.

Actions:

* represent operations that MAY be attempted
* do not imply guarantees
* may fail even when declared

Actions MUST NOT be inferred from:

* availability states
* formats
* links
* prior behavior

---

### 3.2 Action Attachment Point

All fulfillment actions:

* MUST be declared at the **holding** level
* MUST NOT be declared at catalog, collection, item, or edition levels

Higher-level resources MUST NOT imply the presence or absence of fulfillment actions.

---

## 4. Standard Fulfillment Actions

This profile defines the following standard actions.

Servers MAY support any subset of these actions, but MUST follow all rules for any action they declare.

---

### 4.1 `borrow`

The `borrow` action represents an attempt to initiate a loan.

A server declaring `borrow`:

* MUST accept the request and return an explicit outcome
* MUST NOT guarantee success
* MUST NOT encode policy rules in the declaration

Possible outcomes:

* success
* failure
* denial
* pending

---

### 4.2 `hold`

The `hold` action represents an attempt to place a reservation or hold.

A server declaring `hold`:

* MUST treat the action as an attempt, not a promise
* MUST return explicit outcomes

Possible outcomes:

* success
* failure
* denial
* pending

---

### 4.3 `return`

The `return` action represents an attempt to conclude an existing loan.

A server declaring `return`:

* MUST handle the action explicitly
* MUST return a clear outcome

Possible outcomes:

* success
* failure
* denial

---

### 4.4 `renew`

The `renew` action represents an attempt to extend an existing loan.

A server declaring `renew`:

* MUST treat renewal eligibility as server-controlled
* MUST return explicit outcomes

Possible outcomes:

* success
* failure
* denial
* pending

---

### 4.5 `fetch`

The `fetch` action represents an attempt to access or retrieve the content associated with a holding.

The `fetch` action:

* MUST NOT imply immediate delivery
* MAY require authentication or authorization
* MAY redirect to external systems

Possible outcomes:

* success
* failure
* denial
* pending

---

## 5. Action Declaration Requirements

### 5.1 Explicit Declaration

Each action:

* MUST be explicitly declared
* MUST have a stable identifier
* MUST be discoverable without inference

Absence of an action declaration MUST be interpreted as:

* the action is not supported or not permitted
* not as a temporary failure

---

### 5.2 Parameters

Actions MAY declare parameters.

If parameters are declared:

* all required parameters MUST be identified explicitly
* parameter absence MUST result in explicit failure
* servers MUST NOT infer missing parameters

---

## 6. Action Outcomes

### 6.1 Required Outcome Explicitness

Every action execution MUST result in an explicit outcome.

Silent failure, ambiguous success, or implied state changes are forbidden.

---

### 6.2 Outcome Types

The following outcome types are defined:

* **success**
  The requested action completed as intended.

* **failure**
  The action was processed but could not be completed due to a system or operational issue.

* **denial**
  The action was rejected due to policy, eligibility, or authorization.

* **pending**
  The action was accepted but has not yet reached a final state.

---

### 6.3 Outcome Semantics

Outcome types:

* MUST be distinguishable
* MUST NOT be overloaded with policy explanation
* MAY include descriptive messages, but such messages are non-normative

---

## 7. Relationship to Availability

Availability states and fulfillment actions are **independent**.

* Availability MUST NOT imply action success
* Action declaration MUST NOT imply availability
* Actions MAY fail regardless of availability state

Clients MUST treat availability and actions as separate signals.

---

## 8. Authentication and Authorization

This profile does **not** define authentication or identity.

If an action requires authentication:

* the server MUST signal this explicitly
* the server MAY delegate to external systems

Authentication signaling and handoff are defined in **LCAP Auth Handoff**.

---

## 9. Error Handling and Failure Discipline

Servers MUST:

* distinguish denial from failure
* represent indeterminate states explicitly
* avoid best-effort behavior

Clients MUST:

* rely only on explicit outcomes
* avoid retrying actions unless instructed explicitly

---

## 10. Conformance Requirements

An implementation claiming conformance to **LCAP Fulfillment – Basic** MUST:

* be LCAP Core–conformant
* declare actions only at the holding level
* implement all declared actions fully
* return explicit outcomes for every action execution
* avoid inference, defaulting, or silent fallback

An implementation MUST NOT claim conformance if it violates any requirement in this document.

---

## 11. Non-Goals and Explicit Exclusions

This profile MUST NOT define:

* lending policy rules
* patron eligibility logic
* DRM enforcement
* delivery mechanisms
* file formats
* UI flows or messaging
* analytics or tracking

These exclusions are intentional and normative.

---

## 12. Stability and Evolution

LCAP Fulfillment – Basic is frozen.

Future revisions:

* MUST preserve backward compatibility
* MUST NOT weaken explicit outcome semantics
* MUST NOT introduce inference
* MUST respect LCAP Core invariants

Additional fulfillment functionality MUST be introduced through separate profiles.
